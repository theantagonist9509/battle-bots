## Judging

* Your bots will be compete against each other in a [round-robin tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_tournament).
* For each match, you will be awarded 0, 0.5, or 1 point for a loss, draw, or win respectively.
* The final standings will be generated based on the total tournament points of the bots.


## Participation

* Teams can consist of up to two members. Solo participation is also allowed.
* Each team can submit only one bot.
* No prior experience in AI or advanced programming is required – this challenge is designed for beginners!

## Testing
* Use the Bot Tester provided to test your code
* Just add your bot in the Bot_Tester/bots folder
* To simulate a match, run the main.py file given in Bot_Tester

## Submission

* All submissions must be made through the submission link provided above.
* The submission should include:
  1. Your **single file** Python script (named as `teamname_bot.py`)
  2. A brief description explaining your bot's strategy (doesn't need to be very detailed!)
* The deadline for submissions is 7th September, 11:59 PM.
* Late submissions will not be accepted.
* Make sure your code runs without errors and follows the input/output format as explained in the [`example_bot.py`](https://github.com/theantagonist9509/battle-bots/blob/main/example_bot.py) file in this repository.
