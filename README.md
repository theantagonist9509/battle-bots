## Problem Statement

You are tasked with writing a Python script that controls a bot that can play the game of Tic Tac Toe.

**Done with the challenge? [⬆️ SUBMIT HERE](https://forms.gle/3jynTXrTEkQkMWVA6)**

## Judging

* Your bots will be compete against each other in a [round-robin tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_tournament).
* For each match, you will be awarded 0, 0.5, or 1 point for a loss, draw, or win respectively.
* The final standings will be generated based on the total tournament points of the bots.

## Participation

* Teams can consist of up to two members. Solo participation is also allowed.
* Each team can submit only one bot.
* No prior experience in AI or advanced programming is required – this challenge is designed for beginners!

## Testing

To test your script, follow these steps:

* Install Python (if you haven't already) and clone/download this repository.
* Put your bot script(s) in the `bot-tester/bots` directory provided in this repository.
* In the `bot-tester` directory, run `python main.py`
* This will simulate a tournament of all the bots in the `bots` directory (two bots, `random-bot-1.py` and `random-bot-2.py`, have already been provided for your bot to compete against.)

## Submission

* All submissions must be made through the submission link provided above.
* The submission should include:
  1. Your **single file** Python script (named as `teamname_bot.py`)
  2. A brief description explaining your bot's strategy (doesn't need to be very detailed!)
* The deadline for submissions is 7th September, 11:59 PM.
* Late submissions will not be accepted.
* Make sure your code runs without errors and follows the input/output format as explained in the [`example_bot.py`](https://github.com/theantagonist9509/battle-bots/blob/main/example_bot.py) file in this repository.
